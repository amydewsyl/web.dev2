            <h2>What is Life </h2>
              <p> some say life is beautiful and some says its not safe ,
               No one is wrong , rather hat they have seen is different</p>
              <p> Let me share My thoughts </p>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li><h3> Is world safe </h3></li>
              <ul> 
                <li> It is </li>
                <li> Not really </li>
                <li> Maybe </li>
              </ul>
        <br>
             <li><h3>Beauty</h3></li>
                <p> I see the birds in the morning and hear to its chirping ,
              sometimes life is all about what we are missing </p>
                <p> The green trees and blue sky will give you the peace you are searching 
                nature is the best healer</p>
        <br>
             <li><h3>Misery</h3></li>
               <p> Life has to have some terrible face to get you prepare for the future 
               buckle up its not a big thing , you can get through it , don't lose hope </p>
        </ol>
